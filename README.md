# Captyour

This is my first application using React. 

A camera rental web application built using React.js and Bootstrap . I have also used Email JS to connect the HTML form to the owner's email address.
This is live on https://captyour.netlify.app/. It is mobile compatible and desktop compatible as well. Please comment and let me know if any changes are required.
